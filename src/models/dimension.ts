For example: shipmentâ€™s official height is 700mm, width 500mm, length 300mm. The longest side (highest value) of 700mm needs to be entered at Length. Width value becomes 500mm, Height value: 300mm (the lowest). Entering the dimensions in the wrong order may result in incorrect shipping labels and longer delivery times. The maximum dimensions can be found in your PostNL contract. */
